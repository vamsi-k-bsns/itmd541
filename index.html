    I have a bachelor's degree in computer science engineering, and I am now pursuing a Master's in Information Technology and Management. I was not taught any web design or development during my undergrad, so this is actually the first time I'm making a webpage! I have prior experience in IT support but no real web experience to speak of, but I am very excited to learn more over the course of this class.
